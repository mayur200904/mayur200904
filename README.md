👋 Hi, I'm Mayur Tarate, a passionate Computer Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Savitribai Phule Pune University.

🎓 Currently pursuing my BE, I'm on a journey to merge theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience. My academic focus on AI/ML is complemented by practical insights gained during my Java Programmer Internship at CodSoft.

💻 In my internship, I delved into Java programming, honing my skills in a real-world setting. I've also expanded my horizons in the tech world by completing Google Cloud Computing Foundations, where I learned about cloud computing fundamentals and the exciting realm of generative AI.

🚀 On the technical side, my skill set includes CSS, Python, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, and Git. From the basics with CSS and Python to more advanced topics like React.js and Node.js, I've been on a continuous learning journey.

📚 Currently exploring ECMAScript 6+ (ES6+), I believe in staying ahead in the dynamic tech landscape. Learning isn't just a phase; it's a perpetual part of my professional identity.

🌟 Beyond the technical, I've also invested in my personal development through workshops like Personality Development. I believe that a well-rounded skill set, coupled with continuous learning, is the key to success.

🤝 I'm open to connecting with like-minded professionals, sharing insights, and exploring opportunities in the world of AI/ML and beyond. Let's connect and build something incredible together!
